# üìà Monitoring & Logging Implementation Summary

## üéØ Implementation Status: 100% Complete ‚úÖ

The Fuchsio Backend Monitoring & Logging system has been successfully implemented with production-grade functionality.

---

## üìä Completed Features

### **1. Advanced Logging Infrastructure**

- **Winston Logger** with multiple transports (file, console)
- **Log Rotation** with daily file rotation and automatic cleanup
- **Log Levels** (error, warn, info, debug) with environment-based filtering
- **Structured Logging** with timestamps, request IDs, and contextual data

### **2. Comprehensive Monitoring System**

- **Health Check Endpoints** with detailed system status
- **Performance Monitoring** with response time tracking
- **Error Tracking** with automatic alerting and statistics
- **System Metrics** (CPU, memory, database health)

### **3. Audit Trail & Security Monitoring**

- **Authentication Logging** for all login attempts and failures
- **Authorization Tracking** for role-based access monitoring
- **Request Tracing** with unique request IDs throughout the system
- **Security Event Logging** for unauthorized access attempts

### **4. Automated Maintenance System**

- **Scheduled Tasks** with 7 automated operations:
  - Token cleanup (hourly)
  - Log file cleanup (daily)
  - System health checks (every 5 minutes)
  - Database maintenance (daily at 2 AM)
  - Daily report generation (daily at 6 AM)
  - Error tracking cleanup (weekly)
  - Audit log archiving (monthly)

### **5. Performance Tracking**

- **Response Time Monitoring** for all API endpoints
- **Database Query Performance** with slow query detection
- **Memory Usage Tracking** with threshold alerting
- **Concurrent User Monitoring** with WebSocket connection tracking
